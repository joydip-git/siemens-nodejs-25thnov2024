TypeScript:
---------------
1. static type checking
2. strict data typing
3. provides lots of extra fetaures which are not even supported by ES 
note: those extra features will not be emitted when the code is transpiled
4. this is a development mode language, can't be executed in JavaScript runtime (not or production)

Transpiler => TypeScript compiler (tsc)
global: >npm i typescript --location=global
local: >npm i typescript -D

create a config file: tsconfig.json
>.\node_modules\.bin\tsc --init [if tsc is installed locally]
> tsc --init [if tsc is installed globally]


If you are working with TS based node js app:
>npm i @types/node -D
